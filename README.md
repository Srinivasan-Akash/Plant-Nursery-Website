## What i have learnt By working on this project
1. I have improved my self in positioning of images in a spesific position
2. Got a good understanding of `:hover`, `overflow` and images

## Honest Time to finish the project

I had took about 45 min I worked to remove the bullets in the `ul` and `li` elements and added hover effects that took me a bit of time
and understanding the html code occupied about 60% of the time !!
